When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Two main reasons: backups and sharing.  I'm a writer.  I never keep 
the only copy of my novel on the machine I'm working on.  Something 
could happen to it. I always save in multiple places, usually at least
one cloud repository.  That way if something happens to my machine or
the files on it, the whole novel won't be lost or destroyed.  While
someone wanting to sell their novel wouldn't want to post it online 
(because then no publisher would touch it due to it already being
on the Internet), having feedback is a very important thing and if the 
publishing industry weren't the way it is now, it would be lovely
to be able to crowdsource a story, doing open source fiction for everyone
to contribute to, constantly making the narrative better.  I'd really like
to do that with at least one piece of fiction, perhaps an interactive one
so that anyone who liked could contribute to making the story better.  The
results would be fantastic.  They'd be unsellable, but awesome.
